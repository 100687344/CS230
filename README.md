Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available     in an Android app only. Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a       player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as   clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not   guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. The client has requested     that the following software requirements be met for the game application:
    A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
    Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
    Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
    Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  This application has already been developed and released on the Android Play Store. Much of the design development had already been laid out. As requested from the client, the     application needed to be written in a language that would work cross platform. For the duration of this course, I focused on the recreation of the application on PC. I used        Eclipse as my IDE of choice and worked with C++ code. I have worked through each of the problems, and corrected all of the "FIXME" sections of the code to create a foundation      that the remaining system requirments can be built on.
  
 What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  While working on the project, the included design documents were helpful. They gave clear insturction on what needed to be done within the code to ensure a well designed and       working project. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would like to see UML documentation for the system and the given requirments.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Throughout this term, the user's needs were constantly changing, but the overall goal remained the same. The development of any application should keep the end user in mind.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  The design aspect of this project was mostly done and there wasn't much need to design new features. Activly listening to what the client wanted led to the success of this         project. The project covers many key design elements that can be found in many applications. It might be helpful to revist the code or other documentation to help with the         creation of future projects.
